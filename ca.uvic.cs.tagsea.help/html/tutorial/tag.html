<h3>Your First Tag</h3>
</center>

<p>TagSEA is currently coupled with the Eclipse Java Development Toolkit (JDT).
There are plans to expand TagSEA to allow tags to be associated with arbitrary data,
but for now the only way to define a tag is within the eclipse Java editor. To do this,
simply open a Java file in the Java editor, and use a comment to define a tag:</p>

<p class=Code>//@tag mytag : This is a comment for my tag</p>

<p>Tags can appear within any valid Java comment. These are all equivalent:</p>

<p class=Code>
//@tag mytag : This is a comment for my tag</p>
<p class=Code>
/* <br>
 * @tag mytag : This is a comment for my tag<br>
 */
</p>
<p class=Code> 
/**<br>
 * @tag mytag : This is a comment for my tag<br>
 */ 
</p>
</p>

<p>The format is as follows:<p>

<p class=Note><b>@tag</b> <b>tagname</b> <i>&lt;... more-tag-names&gt; &lt;:  comment text &gt; &lt; [ meta-data ] &gt;</i> </p>

<p>Where <b>bold</b> text is required, and text inside &lt;&gt; is optional.</p>

<p>Technically, this line isn't actually for defining a <i>tag</i>, it defines what is called
a <i>waypoint</i>. That is, it defines where a specific instance of a tag exists, as well as
some information for that tag (the comment and the meta-data). However, if a tag with name
<b>tagname</b> doesn't already exist, this comment will also define a new tag for <b>tagname</b>.
</p>

<p>To make it easier to organize and visualize tags, a hierarchy of tags is supported. You
can define the hierarchy within the tag name. This is done by placing child tags within
parenthesis (()). For example, suppose you have several bugs in a program, and you would
like to track them using tags. But, you also have two bug tracking mechanisms (say, sourceforge
and bugzilla). You can tag the problem code using a hierachy:</p>
<p class=Code>//@tag bug(sourceforge(4353846))</p>
<p>The above will mark your code with the tag <code>4353846</code> inside the <code>sourceforge</code>
list of <code>bug</code>s. For bug # 3485 in bugzilla, use:</p>
<p class=Code>//@tag bug(bugzilla(3485))</p>
<p>And, as of version 0.3.4, you can also use dot-notation for hierarchies. The following is
equivalent to the above:</p>
<p class=Code>//@tag bug.bugzilla.3485</p>


<p>Note that it is possible to have multiple tags use the same comment and meta data for a
waypoint. This tag is perfectly legal:<p>

<p class=Code>//@tag mytag mytagtwo : a comment for two tags</p>

<p>The comment comes after a colon (:) sign, and will be assigned to a waypoint for both 
<code>mytag</code> and <code>mytagtwo</code>.</p>

<p>If you want to add extra information about the waypoint, you can do so within meta data.
Meta data is written by placing semi-colon (;) separated key/value pairs
within square brackets. The meta data elements that are currently supported are the author and
the date of the waypoint. Here is an example of a waypoint with meta data:</p>

<p class=Code>//@tag mytag : a comment [Author = me;Date = 14/07/06 11:42 AM;]</p>

<p>Again, the comment is entirely optional. The following is also legal:</p>

<p class=Code>//@tag mytag [Author = me;Date = 14/07/06 11:42 AM;]</p>

<p>Meta data can also be split accross multiple lines:</p>

<p class=Code>
/*<br>
&nbsp;* @tag mytag [<br>
&nbsp;* Author = me;<br>
&nbsp;* Date = 14/07/06 11:42 AM;<br>
&nbsp;*]<br>
&nbsp;*/
</p>
<p>However, tag names and comments must all be on the first line of the tag/waypoint definition.</p>

<p>Experiment with writing tags, and see how useful they can be. TagSEA offers automatic code completion
to make the process even smoother. Simply press <code><i>&lt;Ctrl-space&gt;</i></code> after entering
the <code><b>@tag</b></code> keyword to see the available hints.</p>
