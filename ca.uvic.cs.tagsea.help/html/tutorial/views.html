<h3>Managing Your Tags</h3>
</center>

<p>The power of tags really comes in the ways that it is possible for
you to visualize and manage them. TagSEA offers you a number of views
that help you to do just that. They are the <i>Tags Viewer</i>, the 
<i>Routes Viewer</i>, and <i>CloudSee</i>. They can all be found under
"Window > Show View > Other... > TagSea" in your Eclipse Workbench. This
tutorial offers a brief overview of the views. The best way to get to know the views
is to simply open them and play with them yourself.</p>

<h4>Tags Viewer</h4>

<p>The Tags Viewer will be your most used tag companion.
There are two main parts to the Tags Viewer: the Tag view, and the Waypoints view. The
Tag view is presented as a tree on the left-hand portion of the viewer; the Waypoints view
is the table to the right. The two views are linked so that when you click on a tag in
the Tags view, all of the waypoints that belong to it and to its children are displayed
in the Waypoints view.
</p>
<p>There is a lot of power in the Tags Viewer. First, it presents a complete list of your tags
in a nice tree structure. And if the number of tags is too much for you to handle, you can use
the filtering mechanism to narrow the scope of what you are looking at.</p>

<p>The Tags Viewer is also used to manage your tags. You can drag and drop tags from one point to
another in the tags hierarchy to refactor the way that your tags are organized. And you
can rename the tags as well. Changing the tags in the Tags Viewer will automatically update
your source code, and vice versa.</p>
<p>
<p>The Waypoints view can be used to quickly navigate to the source code that you have tagged. Double
click on a waypoint to have it revealed in the Java editor. You can use the up and down arrows to navigate
as well.</p>

<h4>Routes Viewer</h4>

<p>The Routes Viewer offers you an even more robust way of organizing your waypoints and navigating through
them. You can use the Routes Viewer to create a <i>route</i> of related waypoints. Simply drag-and-drop a
waypoint from the Tags Viewer onto a route. The waypoints can be organized in a logical order for easy navigation.
The above example shows a route for a <i>code walk-thru</i>. Several steps in the walk-thru are presented.
Traversing through the steps in the Routes Viewer will automatically carry you through the walkthru using the
Java editor.</p>

<h4>CloudSee</h4>

<p>CloudSee isn't a tag managing tool, but, rather, a visualization tool. It displays to you your tags
as several "clouds" that have sizes determined by the number of waypoints there are for each tag. If a
tag name has a '+' beside it, you can double-click on it to reveal the tag's children. You can use 
CloudSee to give you an idea of how many times a tag is used relative to other tags.</p>
