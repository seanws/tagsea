<h3>Tags for Software Engineering Activities in Eclipse</h3>
</center>

<p>
TagSEA is a lightweight tool designed to help you to navigate, and <i>tag</i> files and
source code within <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a>. The tags that you create
can be shared between users that have to edit shared content.
</p>

<p>
When managing documents, files, and source code, it can be difficult to keep track of the
ways that they are related to one another, or even important points within the documents.
It becomes even harder when documents are shared and edited among several users.
</p>

<p>For example, if you are a software developer, it is inevitable that
you will, at some point, have to deal with bugs in code. Knowing exactly
where the bugs occur can be a hard thing to determine and keep track of.
Suppose that you have found the source of a bug, but it is going to be a
while before you can work on it. Wouldn't it be nice if there were a
lightweight way for you to <i>tag</i> the problem code so that you or one of your
co-workers can come back to it later? Maybe you would just like to put a
comment in the code, that points it out:</p>
<p class=Code>
//@tag bug(1024) : This code will sometimes cause an infinite loop
</p>
<p>
TagSEA allows you to do just that. It offers a lightweight way for you to tag your files,
then presents you with a user interface to navigate through them.</p>
