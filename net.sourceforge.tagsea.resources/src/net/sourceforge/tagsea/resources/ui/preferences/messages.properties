PreferencePage.info=You have the option of keeping your persisted copy of your waypoints with your projects,\
 or outside of your workspace. If you choose to keep them with your projects, a file called '.resouceWaypoints'\
 will be added to the projects that contain resource waypoints. Note that keeping a copy with your projects\
 will not actually share your waypoints and may cause unwanted conflicts within team projects.
