		<description>
Registering TagSEA will help researchers at the University of Victoria to understand the kinds of users that are using TagSEA. It will allow you to send us information about how you are using TagSEA-information such as the waypoints that you have created. This information is important to us and the development of TagSEA and other tagging utilities.

When you install the TagSEA logging feature, you will be asked to register your copy of TagSEA. You may fill out all the information, or choose to remain anonymous. When you register TagSEA, TagSEA will begin to log your interactions with the platform, and you will be prompted periodically to upload the logged information. You can opt-out of the logging and upload process at any time through the TagSEA Research preference page.

Thank you for using TagSEA and supporting software engineering research.

Uploading your TagSEA logs and waypoints will help to improve bookmarking tools for software engineers. Please select and review the files to upload. Before uploading, you must agree to the terms of the TagSEA Monitoring Consent Agreement.

You can change your TagSEA upload settings using the TagSEA Research preference page.

You are being invited to participate in a study entitled "Tagging to Support Program Navigation".  This study is being done to evaluate a new bookmarking tool for Eclipse, called TagSEA (which stands for Tags for Software Engineering Activities).

Programming can be a challenging task that requires sophisticated tool support. The purpose of this research project is to design more effective bookmarking tools. This study is important because it will lead to more knowledge about how developers bookmark and navigate their source code.  This knowledge can be used to improve tool support. There has been little work done to evaluate how software tools can improve navigation.

The study is being conducted by Dr. Margaret-Anne Storey, a faculty member in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Victoria. She will be assisted by Dr. Li-Te Cheng and Michael Muller from IBM Research, Janice Singer from the National Research Council of Canada, and Del Myers and Jody Ryall from the University of Victoria. If you have further questions, please contact Jody Ryall at: jryall@uvic.ca.   For more information on our research group, please refer to http://www.thechiselgroup.org. This research is being funded by an IBM Eclipse Innovation Grant http://www-3.ibm.com/software/info/university/products/eclipse/eig.html and also, in part, by an NSERC collaborative research and development grant.

Participation in this study requires that you install the TagSEA plugin for Eclipse, and if you find it beneficial, to use it for a period of four to eight weeks.  This study will consist of a software monitoring program that will log information on the tags and waypoints you create, update and use.  At no time will the contents of files (e.g. source code or source code comments) be logged.  Periodically you will be prompted to transmit the logged data to a UVic server.  This period is initially set to one week, but may be adjusted as a user preference.  You may preview the data before it is sent and can choose not to submit the data at that time. The data will be used to improve future tools to support navigation in software development environments.

Your participation is completely voluntary. The following details the amount of time you will need to spend participating in this study. Firstly, you will need to download and install the tool (approx. 15 mins).  You will be prompted to ensure you want to send the data to the study server at regular intervals (e.g. each week).   The TagSEA tool is very simple to use and very easy to learn as it is consistent with other features in the Eclipse environment.  This will require only a few minutes of your time.  At the end of the study you may be invited to participate in an interview or focus group to discuss the TagSEA tool; participation is voluntary. The study will be held over a four to eight week period.

In terms of protecting your anonymity, you will be assigned a unique ID so that your identity will only be accessible to the principal researchers.  The unique identifiers will be used to aggregate your submissions, but will in no way be used to identify you personally. Information gathered from the observation process will only ever be reported as an aggregate description, neither you nor your company will be identifiable in the reported results.  All information disclosed to researchers in this project is confidential. Only trained researchers will be analyzing the data. These researchers are neutral third parties and are not responsible for any evaluation of your work.   All data will be kept secure and protected at all times in password protected files on a secure server. Study data will be kept for two years. At the end of this time computer data files will be deleted.

If you choose, you can withdraw from the study at any time. To withdraw, you may contact Dr. Storey (mstorey@uvic.ca and 250-472-5713) or Jody Ryall (jryall@uvic.ca), or you can select a preference in the Eclipse TagSEA preferences window that will stop any further logging.  You may also request to withdraw previously recorded information by contacting Dr. Storey or Jody Ryall.   Should you withdraw, you will be provided with instructions on how to remove the TagSEA tool.  However, you may also choose to continue using the tool without the logging of data.

There is no compensation offered for participating in this study.  You may benefit from using the tool and you may also gain insight into how you currently bookmark and annotate your code. There are no known or anticipated risks to you by participating in this research.  Tags that have been created with the TagSEA tool will be accessible as bookmarks, tasks or source code comments.  Therefore, you are not required to continue using the tool to access the information entered during the study.

This research may lead to the development of an open source (free) software tool.  All participants will be able to examine the dissemination of the study results via scholarly publications.   In addition to being able to contact the researchers, you may verify the ethical approval of this study, or raise any concerns you might have, by contacting the Associate Vice-President, Research at the University of Victoria (250-472-4545).
