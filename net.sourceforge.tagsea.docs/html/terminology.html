<h3>Terminology</h3>

<p>The usage of the terms <b><i>tag</i></b> and <b><i>waypoint</i></b> 
may be hard to 
get used to because they are not often used
in conjunction with one another. However, they really do enrich one 
another when combined. An anecdotal illustration
may be helpful to understand how they are used.</p>

<p>Suppose you are moving homes, and you have everything packed in boxes 
for the move. You would like to be able 
identify the boxes according to the room that they should go in in the 
new house. You have only one kitchen in
the new house, so you mark all of the boxes that go to the kitchen with 
the word "kitchen". You have several 
bathrooms in the new house, however, so you have to distinguish those 
boxes differently. So, you mark all of the
"bathroom" boxes with the word "bathroom", but you also mark some with 
the word "upstairs" and others with the word
"downstairs."</p>
<p>This illustration demonstrates the basics of tagging and waypointing. 
In this instance, the words that you used
to mark the boxes are the <i>tags</i>. They are short, descriptive words 
that mark a box as interesting. The boxes,
however, are <i>waypoints</i>: they are the <i>places</i> that tags 
exist.</p>
<p>You'll notice that the correspondance between tags and waypoints is 
many-to-many. That is the same tag can be
used on multiple waypoints (places), and the waypoints can have multiple 
tags.</p>
<p>There is a natural, though more abstract, mapping of the concepts of 
tags and waypoints to software artifacts.
In TagSEA, tags are short, descriptive words that "tag" an artifact as 
interesting. Waypoints are related to those
artifacts themselves. The waypoint is the location inside the artifact 
that describes "where" and "what" can be found
there.  The waypoint contains all of the descriptive information for the 
location. 
For example, it could be a line inside a text file, along with the file 
itself, and the tags that exist there.</p>
