<h3>TagSEA View</h3>

<p>The real power of tags, isn't in how they are 
added, it is in how they can be searched and
navigated.  The TagSEA View is available for this purpose.</p>

<h3>Tags Pane</h3>

<center><img src="images/tags.jpg" alt="Tags View"></center>

<p>The tags pane gives you a filtered list of all of the tags available 
in your workspace. You can use the text box
to enter words that may match tags that you are interested in. The tags 
that do not match will be filtered out of
the view, and the visible tags will have their matching regions 
highlighted. The filtering matches <i>any</i> word
you enter into the text field.</p>
<p>TagSEA uses a special naming convention to help you organize your 
tags. The '.' character has a special meaning
in TagSEA: it is used to view tags as a hierarchy. When you view your 
tags as a hierarchy, a number of refactoring
actions are available. You can rename your tags by double-clicking on 
the tag name, or by using the <i>Rename</i> action.
You can re-parent tags by dragging them under a new parent. You can 
delete tags, and you can "generalize" tags. 
Generalizing tags allows you to remove a particular segment of a tag 
name without effecting the sub-tree under that
segment.</p>
<p>Note that the hierarchical view is enforced by naming convention 
only. So, if you would like to add an extra level
to the sub-tree, you can rename a tag and add an extra '.' to the name. 
This will refactor all of the tag names
under that sub-tree.</p>

<p>When you refactor tags, the effective result is to change the name of 
the tags in some way. Some waypoint types
may not allow you to change the names of their tags (for example, if the 
waypoint is created on static, read-only
data). So, your requested refactoring might not cause a global change. 
Don't be surprised if you rename a tag, and
only some waypoints get moved to that new name. Your old tag might 
remain behind.</p>
<p>You can also view your tags using their flat, "raw", dot-separated 
names. When you view them this way, however, 
only the <i>Rename</i> action is available, and it does not guarantee to 
keep the hierarchy consistent.</p>


<h3>The Waypoints Pane</h3>

<center><img src="images/waypoint_pane.png" alt="Waypoints 
View"></center>

<p>The waypoints view is your point of interaction for all of your 
waypoints. It is separated into 2 sections:</p>
<ol type="A">

<li><b>The Waypoint Table</b>: <p>This is a filtered table of the 
waypoints that can be found by TagSEA. Each line
represents one waypoint. It has an icon that indicates the kind of 
waypoint that is on that line, and some descriptive
text about the waypoint. The table helps you
to navigate to where software artifacts have been tagged. 
Double-clicking on any waypoint will navigate to the 
location of that waypoint. How this occurrs is dependant on the type of 
waypoint. For example, java waypoints will
open up a java editor and select the region that the waypoint is on.</p>

<p>You can filter what is in the view by editing the text box above the 
table. Entering single words will filter the
waypoints based on thier label. The portion of the text that matches the 
filter is highlighted in the label. You can
also filter based on what tags are on the waypoint: simply type 
something like "@tag-name" to filter out the waypoints
that don't have a tag that matches "tag-name". Finally, you can filter 
based on property values on the waypoint. For
example, you can use the fomat "author=John" to see all of the waypoints 
whose author name *starts with* the word
John. You can also use "date&lt;01/01/01" to get all the waypoints that 
are dated after January 1st, 2001. The format of
the date will depend on what locale you are in. Pressing Ctrl-space will 
give you a list of applicable property names.</p>
</li>

<li><b>The Tags Section</b>:
<p>This section lists all of the tags that are on the selected 
waypoint(s). Clicking on a tag name will open it in
the Tags Viewer. If only one waypoint is selected, you can use the 
<b>Edit</b> button to change what tags are on the
selected waypoint</p>
</li>
</ol>


<h4>The Properties Dialog</h4>:

<center><img src="images/properties_dialog.jpg" alt="Properties Dialog"></center>

<p>To find out more detailed properties about a tagged location, you can right click on the waypoint and select 'properties'. 
Some of these properties can be edited, depending on the type of 
waypoint you created. When you edit a property here, the
contributed waypoint type has the responsibility to make sure that the 
platform is updated appropriately. For example,
if you change the value of "Author" for a java waypoint, the java source 
for that waypoint will be automatically updated.
</p>
</li>


<p>If you do not specify a tag for a given waypoint, it will be assigned the "default" tag.  Those tags that have <i>only</i> the
default filter will be displayed as grey in the waypoint table. In 
tagsea, these are often considered to be "unused" waypoints because they haven't been tagged with any "useful" tag names. 
There is a convenience action to automatically delete all of these waypoints. Be careful though: some of the waypoints 
may actually be useful. You will be presented with a dialog before the deletion so that you can select specifically 
which waypoints to delete.</p>
