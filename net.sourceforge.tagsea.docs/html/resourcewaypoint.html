<h3>Tagging Resources</h3>

<p>TagSEA 0.6 comes standard with the ability to tag any resource in your workspace. 
These tagged locations are stored in an xml file in your workspace, rather than directly in the code. 
The interface for creating these "resource waypoints" is relatively simple.</p>

<h4>Adding a New Waypoint</h4>

<p>A simple UI is provided for adding a new waypoint to a resource. You 
can simply right-click on any resource in
your workbench. Alternatively, you can right-click in any text editor, 
or on a text-editor's vertical ruler to 
display its context menu (provided that the editor is editing a file in 
the workspace). In the context menu, select

<i>Tags&gt;Add Waypoint...</i> to open up the waypoint edit dialog:</p>

<p>There are several fields that you can edit:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tags</b>: This is a content-aware text box that lets you type in 
the names of the tags (separated by spaces)
that you would like to apply to the waypoint. Press Ctrl-space at any 
time to get content assistance.
Alternatively, you can select the "Select" button to display a list
dialog to select the tags that you would like to add to the 
waypoint.</li>
<li><b>Author</b>: The name of the person who created the waypoint. It 
defaults to the current user.</li>

<li><b>Message</b>: A message that you would like to display with the 
waypoint</li>
<li><b>Date</b>: The date that the waypoint was created. You can change 
this by selecting the "Set Date" button.</li>
</ul>

<p>The remaining fields are not editable. The are set depending on the 
context in which the action was performed
to open the dialog.</p>

<p>That's it! Your resource waypoints are persisted for the resources in 
your projects. By default, they are stored
in an xml file in the .metadata area of your workspace. They can, 
however, be saved in your projects as well using
by changing the preferences on the "Resource Waypoints" preference page, 
or the "Resource Waypoints" properties
page for a project:</p>
