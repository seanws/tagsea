<p>TagSEA was not implemented merely as a tool to support source
code tagging in Java. It was designed as an extensible framework for
creating tags within your working environment. Exemplary extensions have
been created for tagging Java source, web pages, resources, and tasks.</p>

<p>Still, TagSEA was created for software developers concerned with
being able to find source code. So, new with version 0.6.6, there are
some features that make it easy for you to extend TagSEA to support the
reading of standard-formatted waypoints from almost any source language.</p>

<h4><a name=syntax></a>Standard Waypoint Syntax</h4>

<p>From the early days of TagSEA, when only Java was supported, a
standard syntax was defined as:</p>
<p class="Code">//@tag <i>tag-names meta-data : message</i></p>
<p>Where <code><i>tag-names</i></code> is a white-space-separated
list of tag names to be applied in the code, <code><i>meta-data</i></code>
is a white-space-separated list of meta data to be applied in the code,
and <code><i>message</i></code> is a display message for the waypoint in
the code.</p>

<p>Tag names can be single words, or they can be part of a
hierarchy. Hierarchies are defined by dot-separation between the tag
words. For example:</p>

<p class="code">//@tag hack bug.1234</p>

<p>Will create a waypoint that has the tags <code>hack</code> and <code>bug.1234</code>
where <code>1234</code> is considered a sub-tag of <code>bug</code>.</p>

<p>There are two types of meta-data that can be applied: <i>names</i>
and <i>dates</i>. Where a name can be specified by <code>-name="<i>name</i>"</code>
and a date can be specified by <code>-date="<i>date-code</i>"</code>.
The date-code is a locale-specific date of the format <code><i>languageCOUNTRY:date</i></code>.
For example, we can add an author and a date to the previous waypoint:</p>

<p class="code">//@tag hack bug.1234 -author="Joe Shmidt"
-date="enCA:01/01/01"
<p>This would create a waypoint with an author of Joe Shmidt, and a
date of January first, 2001 in English speaking Canada.</p>

<h4><a name="contributing"></a>Contributing a Standard Parsed Waypoint</h4>

<p>This standard format for parsed waypoints makes it easy to
imagine the usage of parsed waypoints in many other languages besides
Java. Since programming languages are just in plain text, and the text
that we are considering is standard, the same parsers can be used to
discover waypoints for all different languages. The only missing part of
the puzzle is how to discover the areas of text that contain valid
waypoints. Since waypoints can't be a part of the proper program, the
natural place to put them is in comments. So, an extension point has
been defined to allow extenders to contribute their own standard parsed
waypoints.</p>

<p>Let's consider the Perl programming language. There are really
only two pieces of information that we need to know about Perl: the
standard file names that are used to define a Perl program; and the way
that comments are defined in Perl.</p>

<p>In Eclipse, there is a way to define content types associated
with files. For example, the JDT defines a content type for files that
represent java programs. For this example, though, we don't want to
depend on any third-party Perl IDE plugins, so we will just use the file
extensions for Perl programs. These file extensions are <code>.pl</code>
and <code>.pm</code>.</p>

<p>As for defining how the parser finds comments, there are two
steps. First, we must tell the plugin what characters to look for. For
Perl, this is straight-forward because Perl only has single-line
comments. The begin with a hash (<code>#</code>) symbol. But we have to
be careful. There are certain cases when we don't want the hash-symbol
to be considered as a comment. For example, within strings or regex's.
Otherwise, a piece of code such as:</p>

<p class="code">print "#1 : the first number\n";</p>

<p>would be considered a comment. In order to deal with these
situations, TagSEA provides an "exclusion" mechanism. We will define
areas within quote-like characters (<code>'</code> and <code>"</code>)
as areas to be excluded. We also want to ignore regex areas. Perl
complicates this by allowing the regex syntax to be changed dynamically.
Since we can't anticipate all possible scenarios, we will simplify the
problem by just excluding areas between the standard '/' characters. The
final plugin XML code looks like this:</p>

<pre>

&lt;extension
    point="net.sourceforge.tagsea.parsed.standardComment"&gt;
    &lt;definition
            fileAssociations="*.pl,*.pm"
            kind="net.sourceforge.tagse.parsed.perl.waypoint"
            name="Parsed Per Waypoints"&gt;
         &lt;singleline
               open="#"&gt;
         &lt;/singleline&gt;
         &lt;exclusion
               close="&apos;"
               open="&apos;"&gt;
         &lt;/exclusion&gt;
         &lt;exclusion
               close="&amp;quot;"
               open="&amp;quot;"&gt;
         &lt;/exclusion&gt;
         &lt;exclusion
               close="/"
               open="/"&gt;
         &lt;/exclusion&gt;
    &lt;/definition&gt;
&lt;/extension&gt;
</pre>

<p>And that's it. That is all you have to do. The TagSEA platform
will automatically create the parsers, the markers, the icons, and the
refactoring support for you. Now, you are ready to start using waypoints
inside your Perl code.</p>

<h4><a name="tweeking"></a>Tweeking the contribution</h4>
<p>Though everything you need is now available, and you are ready to
start using waypoints in your Perl code, it might be nice to tweek it a
little. For example, it would be nice to have a way of making sure that
Perl waypoints are distinguishable in the TagSEA ui. There is a simple
interface for this called <code>IParsedWaypointPresentation</code>. It
offers a number of methods which provide images and labels for your
parsed waypoint.</p>

<p>For now, we are only interested in decorating an image to
indicate that the waypoint is in a Perl file. The standard image for
Perl is a camel <img src="images/perl.gif" />. So we'll use that. TagSEA
also offers some decorations for images to indicate that an image is a
waypoint, and that it is parsed. We'll use those as well to decorate our
image. The methods of interest in our implementation are <code>getImage(IWaypoint)</code>
and <code>getImage()</code>. They look like this:</p>

<pre>
public Image getImage(IWaypoint waypoint) {
    return getImage();
}
public Image getImage() {
    ImageRegistry registry = PerlWaypointPlugin.getDefault().getImageRegistry();
    Image image = registry.get("PERL_WAYPOINT_IMAGE");
    if (image == null) {
        //construct the image from various adornments.
        Image base = registry.get("PERL_ICON");
        ImageDescriptor overlay = 
            TagSEAPlugin.
                getDefault().
                getImageRegistry().
                getDescriptor(ITagSEAImageConstants.IMG_WAYPOINT_OVERLAY);
        ImageDescriptor overlay2 = 
            ParsedWaypointPlugin.
                getDefault().
                getImageRegistry().
                getDescriptor(IParsedWaypointImageConstants.PARSE_OVERLAY);
        DecorationOverlayIcon icon = 
            new DecorationOverlayIcon(
                base, new ImageDescriptor[] {
                    overlay,  null, null, overlay2, null
                }
            );
        registry.put("PERL_WAYPOINT_IMAGE", icon);
        image = registry.get("PERL_WAYPOINT_IMAGE");
    }
    return image;
}
</pre>

<p>This assumes that our plugin object has an icon called "PERL_ICON" in its image registry. That icon is the camel
image.</p>
<p>Finally, we have to tell the plugin that the new waypoint kind has a presentation associated with it. This is
done through the "presentation" attribute in the plugin xml. The final XML looks like this:</p>

<pre>
&lt;extension
    point="net.sourceforge.tagsea.parsed.standardComment"&gt;
    &lt;definition
            fileAssociations="*.pl,*.pm"
            kind="net.sourceforge.tagse.parsed.perl.waypoint"
            name="Parsed Per Waypoints",
            <b>presentation="net.sourceforge.tagsea.parsed.perl.PerlWaypointPresentation"</b>&gt;
         &lt;singleline
               open="#"&gt;
         &lt;/singleline&gt;
         &lt;exclusion
               close="&apos;"
               open="&apos;"&gt;
         &lt;/exclusion&gt;
         &lt;exclusion
               close="&amp;quot;"
               open="&amp;quot;"&gt;
         &lt;/exclusion&gt;
         &lt;exclusion
               close="/"
               open="/"&gt;
         &lt;/exclusion&gt;
    &lt;/definition&gt;
&lt;/extension&gt;
</pre>

<h3><a name="control"></a>More Control</h3>

<p>It is possible to create all kinds of different waypoints that don't necessarily follow the standard syntax, though
it is normally better to follow a standard way of writing waypoints. Nonetheless, another extension point--
<code>net.sourceforge.tagsea.parsed.parsedWaypoint</code> exists for this purpose. It allows you to define your own
parsers and refactoring support. See the extension point documentation, and the example project
<code>net.sourceforge.tagsea.parsed.javabang</code> for an example. The "javabang" plugin allows you to add tags in a
much more light-weight manner: by simply placing a <i>back-tick</i> (`) character in front of the word that you want
to be a tag. For example:</p>

<p class="code">//this code is a `hack</p>

<p>The above will create a waypoint with the tag <b>hack</b> applied to it, and a message of <i>this code is a hack</i>.
Other metadata is not supported by this kind of waypoint.</p>
<p>Note also that parsed waypoint kinds are not allowed to overlap in a file. If you have both Java waypoints and
"Simple Java" waypoints installed, the following code will cause a conflict:</p>

<p class="code">//@tag `hack : this code is a hack</p>

<p>Because the word <b>`hack</b> is recognized by both parsers.</p>

<p>It is possible to create waypoints for more than just source code, as well. TagSEA comes with several different
types of waypoints for waypointing on arbitrary resources, Java Task Tags, breakpoints, and URLs. These all use the
<code>net.sourceforge.tagsea.waypoint</code> extension point. Using this extension point, you can create a new 
<b>Waypoint Delegate</b>. Waypoint delegates are responsible for the full lifecycle of waypoints, from their creation
to their death. They are also responsible for reacting to changes to waypoints, and allowing/dissallowing those changes.
The following plugins make use of the <code>net.sourceforge.tagsea.waypoint</code> extension point:</p> 
<p><code>net.sourceforge.tagsea.url<br>net.sourceforge.tagsea.parsed<br>net.sourceforge.tagsea.tasks<br>
net.sourceforge.tagsea.resources<br>net.sourceforge.tagsea.breakpoint</code></p>
