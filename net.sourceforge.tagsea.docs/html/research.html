<p>TagSEA is developed by researchers at the University of Victoria and at IBM Cambridge. 
Our development of this tool is an iterative process that involves both implementation
and evaluation.  We are conducting a series of user studies to determine how software developers
are using our tool and how we can improve it.</p>

<p>The results of our studies are available 
on this site (see <a href="#survey">results</a>) and in our <a href="#pubs">publications</a>.</p>
 
<p>If you would like to contribute to this project by being a part of our studies, please contact Dr. 
Margaret-Anne Storey (email: <a href="mailto:mstorey@uvic.ca">mstorey@uvic.ca</a>)</p>

<h4><a name="study"></a>Recent User Study</h4>

<p><b><i>Our user study has now finished, and the registration feature is no longer included in the download.</i></b></p>

<p>To better understand how people navigate and tag their source code, 
we are running a user study along with the release of version 0.6.2 of TagSEA.  <b>This study is entirely 
voluntary,</b> however, we hope you will be 
willing to participate in research that can improve this free software 
tool.</p>

<p>When you first install TagSEA 0.6.2, you will be asked if you would 
like to participate in the study by registering your version of the 
tool.  You will be presented with the consent form for the study at this 
time. If you choose to register, you will be assigned a unique ID.  You 
may also choose to participate anonymously by selecting the checkbox at 
the bottom of the registration screen.  In this case, no identifying 
information will be sent to us.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="images/registration.jpg" 
alt="TagSEA 0.6.2 Registration Screenshot"></div><br>

<p>If you choose to participate, TagSEA 0.6.2 includes a software 
monitoring program that will log information on the tags and waypoints 
you create, as well as your interactions with the views directly 
associated with TagSEA (i.e. WaypointView, TagsView and CloudSeeView).  
We do <b>NOT</b> collect any source code.  Periodically you will be 
prompted to transmit the logged data to a UVic server. This period is 
initially set to one week, but may be adjusted as a user preference.  
You will be given the opportunity to review these files at this 
time.</p>

<p>There is no compensation offered for participating in this study. You 
may benefit from using the tool and you 
may also gain insight into how you currently bookmark and annotate your 
code. Tags that have been created using 
TagSEA will be accessible as bookmarks, tasks or source code comments. 
Therefore, you are not required to 
continue using the tool to access the information entered during the 
study.</p>

<p>For more detailed information about this study, please refer to our 
<a href="http://tagsea.sourceforge.net/consentform.html">consent 
form</a>.  In addition, if you have 
any questions regarding this study, we would be happy to talk to you.  
You can contact us at: mstorey@uvic.ca.</p>

<p>This study has received ethical approval from the University of 
Victoria's Human Research Ethics Board.  If 
you would like to verify the ethical approval of this study, or raise 
any concerns you might have, you may 
contact the Associate Vice-President, Research at the University of 
Victoria (250-472-4545).</p>

<p>Thanks for your interest in TagSEA!</p>

<h4><a name="survey"></a>Results of Code Commenting Survey</h4>

<p>In April 2007, we asked software developers how they comment their 
code in a survey posted using <a 
href="http://www.surveymonkey.com">SurveyMonkey</a>.  The survey was 
posted on the blog of Bjorn Freeman-Benson, and showed up on <a 
href="http://planeteclipse.org/planet/">PlanetEclipse</a>.</p>  

<p>Here is a summary of the <a href="surveyResults.pdf">results 
(pdf)</a> of 
the survey.  The results of two of the questions were open-ended; the 
results from these questions are displayed below.  The free-form 
responses at the end are not shown here to presereve anonymity.</p>

<br>
<p><b><i>Q: How many years have you been programming 
professionally?</i></b></p>

<p># of responses = 81<br>
<br>
Min: 0<br>
Average: 9.3<br>
Max: 25<br>
Standard deviation: 6.6</p>
<br>
<p><b><i>Q: Based on your most recent team experience, how many 
programmers 
work in your team (including yourself)?</i></b></p>

<p># of responses = 70<br>
<br>
Min: 2<br>
Average: 9.2 <br>
Max: 100<br>
Standard dev: 14.2</p>

<p><b>Please see the <a href="surveyResults.pdf">pdf file</a> for the 
rest of the results.</b></p>

<p>We'd like to thank <a 
href="http://eclipse-projects.blogspot.com/">Bjorn Freeman-Benson</a> 
for blogging about the survey, as well as all of the people who helped 
out by completing the survey.  Thanks!</p>
