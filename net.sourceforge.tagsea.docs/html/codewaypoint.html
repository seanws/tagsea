<h3>Tagging directly in the source code (Java, C and C++ code)</h3>

<p>TagSEA allows you to tag locations of interest directly in your source code 
as you type. The following example shows you how you can waypoint on 
your source code with a single tag:</p>

<p class="Code">//@tag mytag : This is a comment for my waypoint</p>

<p>Waypoints can appear within any valid Java comment, but only exist on 
a single line. These are all equivalent:</p>

<p class="Code">
//@tag mytag : This is a comment for my waypoint</p>

<p class="Code">
/* <br> * @tag mytag : This is a comment for my waypoint <br> */
</p>

<p class="Code">
/** <br> * @tag mytag : This is a comment for my waypoint <br> */ 

</p>

<p></p>

<p>In the above example, the word "@tag" in the comment indicates that 
this location (or waypoint) has been tagged as interesting.
The words immediately following this indicator are the <i>tag names</i>, or keywords
that you can use to return to this location later. The waypoint includes all of the defining features of that place, such
as the file that contains the tags, the location in that file (both 
implicitly known by where the text has been
typed), as well as other meta-data. In this example, the only other data 
that is included is
a comment, which is placed after the colon (:) and has the text: "This 
is a comment for my waypoint".</p>

<p>The format is as follows:</p>

<p class="Note"><b>@tag</b> <b>tagname</b> <i>&lt;... 
more-tag-names&gt;</i> <i>&lt;... meta-data&gt; &lt;:  comment text 

&gt;</i> </p>

<p>Where <b>bold</b> text is required, and text inside &lt;&gt; is 
optional.</p>

<h4>Tag Names</h4>

<p>Tag names are descriptive keywords for a location. They can contain any 
characters except white-space (spaces, tabs, or new-lines), or colons.</p>

<p>Names that have dots (.) in them can be treated as hierarchical in 
the 
views. For example, the tag name
<code>tagsea.bug.12</code> could represent bug number 12 inside the 
tagsea project, and can be visualized as
such inside the Tags View.</p>

<p>Older versions of TagSEA used a different syntax in Java tag names to 
represent hierarchies. They used
a parenthesis syntax. So, the above tag name would be represented as 
<code>tagsea(bug(12))</code>. For 
backward-compatablity, this syntax is still allowed inside the Java 
waypointing plugin, but it will be translated
into the standard dot-syntax within the platform. However, since both 
parentheses and dots have the same interpretation
in the Java waypointing plugin, it is illegal to have a tag name that 
contains both dots and parentheses.</p>

<p>Content-assist is supplied for tag names for when the get too long. 
Press Ctrl-space to get a list of known
tag names.</p>

<h4>Author metadata</h4>

<p>You can add metadata to identify the author of a tagged location.</p>

<p>For example:</p>
<p class="Code">//@tag mytag <b>-author=John</b> : This is a comment for 
my waypoint</p>
<p>or if the author's name contains a space:</p>
<p class="Code">//@tag mytag <b>-author="John Doe"</b> : This is a 
comment for my waypoint</p>

<p>Since the colon character has a special function, 
attribute values that have colons in them must also be placed in quotes. Attribute values 
cannot have quotes as part of the value.</p>

<h4>Date metadata</h4>

<p>You can also specify a date. TagSEA supports date 
formats for different regions of the world. The format for a 
locale-specific date is:</p>
		
<p class="code">-date="<i>languageCOUNTRY</i>:<i>Short-Date</i>"</p>

		<p>Where <code><i>language</i></code> is the two-letter 
ISO language code, 
		<code><i>COUNTRY</i></code> is the two-letter ISO 
country code, and 
		<code><i>Short-Date</i></code> is the short-date format 
as defined by the Java standard.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>
		
<p>January 15, 2007 in Canada:</p>

<p class="Code">//@tag mytag <b>-date="enCA:15/01/07"</b> : This is a 
comment for my waypoint</p>

<p>January 15, 2007 in US:</p>

<p class="code">//@tag mytag <b>-date="enUS:01/15/07"</b> : This is a 
comment for my waypoint</p>

<p>If no locale is specified, the default locale is used.</p>

<h4>Content assist &amp; quick fixes</h4>

<p>All of this can be a lot of stuff to type into a waypoint, so 
content-assists (<i>Ctrl-space</i>) and
quick-fixes (<i>Ctrl-1</i>) are contributed to make things smoother. 
These two features will automatically
enter the current user as the author, and the current day as the date 
within your tag comment.</p>
